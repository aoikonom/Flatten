# Project Title

Flatten array

## Getting Started
Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g.
```
[[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]. 
```

Two functions are give flatten and flattenRecursive


## Running the tests

testFlattent() performs some tests

### Break down into end to end tests



```
 flatten([3,5, [11, 15, 3, [2, 4]], 12, [2, [[2, 4], 11], 10], [1,2]]) = [3, 5, 11, 15, 3, 2, 4, 12, 2, 2, 4, 11, 10, 1, 2]
```
